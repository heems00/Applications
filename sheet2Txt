#excel2Text.py
# A program that can open a spreadsheet and write the cells of Column A into 1 text file, the cells of Column B into a 2nd text file and so on.

import os
import openpyxl
import pandas as pd

#Determine what excel file you would like converted, and ensure the names are changed accordingly:
path = 'C:\\Users\\tyson\\mu_code'
print('Enter the file names you wish to have inserted into the spreadsheet (i.e., filename.xlsx):')
fileName = input()
print('Enter the worksheet you would like the program to convert (i.e., Sheet):')
workSheet = input()

#Function - Convert Excel Columns As A Single Txt File:
def convert_column_to_text(filename, worksheet_name, column_index, output_filename):
    wbook = openpyxl.load_workbook(filename)
    wsheet = wbook[worksheet_name]

            else:

#Load the workbook and worksheet

#Format and create txt files:
